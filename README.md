# machLearn-capstoneProject
This is the github repo for the udacity machine learning capstone submission.
This project uses the dataset contained in the data/ directory.
All code for this project was completed using Python 3.
This project makes us of the following Python libs:
numpy
pandas
sklearn
time
matplotlib
keras
Code References:
1. The simulations were completed using the Python programming language (Python Software Foundation, https://www.python.org/).
2. Scientific Computing was completed using the Numpy module , please see http://www.numpy.org/.
3. Dataset manipulation was completed through the use of the Pandas module.
4. Sklearn was heavily used throughout the project, more information can be found at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/.7
5. The Time module was used to monitor start and end times of model training/testing, ://docs.python.org/2/library/time.htmlctivation='relu', input_shape=(400, 400, 1)))
6. Matplotlib assisted in the plotting and display of graphics, https://matplotlib.org/
7. Keras was used to build out the neural network model, https://keras.io/.
